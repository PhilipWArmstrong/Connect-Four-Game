This is the README.md file for Connect Four Game. 
This will be submitted as my first project for General Assembly. 

About the Game:
Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

Object of the Game:
Connect four of your checkers in a row while preventing your opponent from doing the same.
